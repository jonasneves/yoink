# Privacy Policy URL for Chrome Web Store

## Current Setup

The privacy policy is located at:
- **File:** `PRIVACY.md` in the repository root
- **GitHub URL:** https://github.com/jonasneves/canvasflow/blob/main/PRIVACY.md

## For Chrome Web Store Submission

When submitting to the Chrome Web Store, use this URL in the "Privacy Policy" field:

```
https://github.com/jonasneves/canvasflow/blob/main/PRIVACY.md
```

### Alternative: GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want a cleaner URL, you can enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Set source to "main" branch
3. Privacy policy will be available at:
   ```
   https://jonasneves.github.io/canvasflow/PRIVACY.html
   ```

## Chrome Web Store Requirements
