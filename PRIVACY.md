# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 17, 2024

## Overview

CanvasFlow is a Chrome extension that enhances your Canvas LMS experience with AI-powered insights. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Storage

### Local Data Storage

All Canvas data accessed by CanvasFlow is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This includes:

- Course information (names, codes, term data)
- Assignment details (titles, due dates, submission status, grades)
- Calendar events
- User preferences and settings

**This data never leaves your device except as described below.**

### Canvas LMS Access

CanvasFlow accesses your Canvas LMS data through the Canvas API using your existing browser session. We do not collect, store, or transmit your Canvas credentials. All Canvas API requests are made directly from your browser to your institution's Canvas instance.

## Third-Party Services

### GitHub Models API (Optional)

When you explicitly request AI-powered insights or schedule generation:

- Assignment data (titles, due dates, courses, points) is sent to GitHub Models API
- Your GitHub token is stored locally in Chrome's secure storage
- We do not collect, store, or have access to your token or the data sent to GitHub Models
- GitHub Models API usage is subject to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)

**AI features are entirely optional.** You can use CanvasFlow without providing a token or generating AI insights.

### MCP Server (Optional)

The optional Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Claude Desktop integration:

- Runs locally on your machine
- Communicates with the Chrome extension via native messaging
- Does not send data to external servers
- Only processes data when explicitly queried through Claude Desktop

## Data We Do NOT Collect

CanvasFlow does not:

- Collect personal information
- Track your browsing activity
- Send data to analytics services
- Share data with third parties (except GitHub Models API when you request AI features)
- Use cookies or tracking technologies
- Sell or monetize your data

## Data Security

- All Canvas data is stored locally using Chrome's secure storage API
- Tokens are stored using Chrome's encrypted storage
- Communication between components uses secure local protocols
- No data is transmitted over the internet except direct Canvas API calls and optional GitHub Models API requests

## User Control

You have full control over your data:

- All data is stored locally and can be cleared by removing the extension
- AI features are opt-in and require explicit user action
- You can disconnect GitHub Models API access at any time by removing your token
- No data persists on external servers after the extension is removed

## Data Retention
