  - Suggestion 5: Extension in action on Canvas page

**Optional**:

### 5. Privacy Policy

**Status**: ❌ NEEDS CREATION

**Required because**:
- Extension collects Canvas assignment data (course names, due dates, titles)
- Sends data to Claude API when user requests AI insights
- Stores Claude API key locally

**Must include**:
1. What data is collected
   - Canvas assignments (titles, due dates, courses, status)
   - Claude API key (stored locally)
2. How data is used
   - Display assignments in sidepanel/schedule
   - Generate AI insights when requested
   - Local caching for performance
3. Third-party services
   - Claude API (Anthropic) - data sent only on user action
4. Data storage
   - All data stored locally in Chrome storage
   - No remote database or analytics
5. Data security
   - API key encrypted by Chrome storage
   - HTTPS for all API calls
   - No data sold or shared with third parties

**Action**: Create `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and host it publicly (GitHub Pages or extension website)

### 6. Permissions Justification

**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS DOCUMENTATION

Current permissions and justifications:

| Permission | Justification Required |
|------------|------------------------|
| `storage` | Store user settings, API key, and cached Canvas assignments locally |
| `activeTab` | Read assignment data from current Canvas LMS page |
| `tabs` | Open weekly schedule in new tab when user clicks button |
| `alarms` | Schedule automatic Canvas data refresh based on user preference |
| `scripting` | Inject content script to extract assignment data from Canvas pages |
| `nativeMessaging` | Optional: Connect to native MCP server for Claude Desktop integration |
| `sidePanel` | Display Canvas assignments and AI insights in Chrome sidepanel |
| `*.instructure.com` | Access Canvas LMS sites on Instructure domain (primary Canvas provider) |
| `*.canvaslms.com` | Access Canvas LMS sites on alternative Canvas domain |
| `canvas.*.edu` | Access university-hosted Canvas instances (e.g., canvas.duke.edu) |
| `api.anthropic.com` | Send AI analysis requests to Claude API when user requests insights |

**Action**: Enter these justifications in Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard during submission

### 7. Permissions Review

**Status**: ✅ APPROPRIATE

**Analysis**:
- All permissions are necessary for stated functionality
- No excessive or unnecessary permissions requested
- Permissions align with "Single Purpose" policy (Canvas LMS enhancement)
- Host permissions limited to Canvas domains would be more restrictive, but `<all_urls>` needed for varied Canvas instances

**Update**: ✅ Restricted `<all_urls>` to specific domains:
```json
"host_permissions": [
  "*://*.instructure.com/*",
  "*://*.canvaslms.com/*",
  "*://canvas.*.edu/*",
  "https://api.anthropic.com/*"
]
```
This covers standard Canvas hosting, university-hosted instances (e.g., canvas.duke.edu), and Claude API while significantly reducing permission scope.

### 8. Content Scripts

**Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT

- Matches limited to Canvas domains
- Runs at `document_idle` (non-intrusive)
- Only extracts visible assignment data
- No DOM manipulation or ad injection

### 9. Testing Requirements

**Pre-submission Testing**:
- ✅ Extension loads without errors
- ✅ All features functional after restructure
- ✅ No console errors during normal operation
- ✅ CSP compliance verified
- ⚠️ Test on multiple Canvas instances (recommended)
- ⚠️ Test API key configuration flow
- ⚠️ Verify AI insights generation
- ⚠️ Test weekly schedule generation

### 10. Developer Account Requirements

**Required**:
- Developer account with $5 one-time registration fee
- 2-Step Verification enabled (mandatory as of 2025)
- Valid payment method on file
